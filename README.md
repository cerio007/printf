## _printf()
The printf project is a collaboration between **Moshood Ahmed** and **Abosi Chijioke Cyorian**, students of Software Engineering at ALX.

This function named `_printf()` imitates the actual `printf()` command located in the` stdio.h` library of C programming Language. It contains some of the basic features and functions found in the manual 3 of `printf`.

`_printf()` is a function that performs formatted output conversion and print data. Its prototype is:

 ` int _printf(const char *format, ...)`
Where format contains the string that is printed.

`_printf()` is a variadic function, it can receives n arguments that replace by n tags written inside the string.

The format tags prototype is:

`%[flags][length]specifier`
If the program runs successfully, the return value is the amount of chars printed.
